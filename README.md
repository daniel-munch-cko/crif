# How to set up the service

1. Install Docker CE for Windows or Mac [here](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
2. To run the service execute the following command in command line (_Shell_ or _Powershell_)

```shell
docker run --rm -e ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://*:5000 -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development -it -p 5000:5000 vladimiraleksandrovcko/crif-rest:16-Apr-2018
```

3. Do not close the command line window while the service is running.

4. Send requests against http://localhost:5000/creditcheck

5. Error log messages can be viewed in command line window from step 2.

6. To terminate the service press Ctrl+C in the command line (the Docker container will be automatically stopped and removed).
